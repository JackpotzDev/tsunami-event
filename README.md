# Tsunami event website
This is a website i made for the Tsunami Event for a client.

Initial Commit - Added the full website :
- Landing page with navbar
- Inscription Form and PHP backend to send info to a database (local for the moment)
- Info page with some placeholder text
- A footer with placeholder text

- Website is responsive (in case of bugs send me a message on discord)
